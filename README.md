### Project Overview

This assignment tests your ability to apply the **AI Development Workflow** to a real-world scenario. You will:

* Define and scope an AI problem
* Design data collection and preprocessing strategies
* Develop, evaluate, and deploy a model
* Critically analyze ethical and practical challenges

Work in **peer groups** to collaborate on solutions and share insights.

---

### Assignment Structure

The assignment is divided into four parts:

1. **Short Answer Questions** (30 points)
2. **Case Study Application** (40 points)
3. **Critical Thinking** (20 points)
4. **Reflection & Workflow Diagram** (10 points)

Each part has specific tasks and point allocations. Refer to [Parts Breakdown](#parts-breakdown) below for details.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-dev-workflow.git
   cd ai-dev-workflow
   ```
2. **Install requirements** (if any):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Organize your work** in clearly named directories and files. Comment all code thoroughly.

---

### Submission Guidelines

* **PDF Report**: 5â€“10 pages (excluding diagrams), structured with headings and references.
* **GitHub Repo**: Include all source code and notebooks. Ensure comments and README are up to date.
* **Community Article**: Publish the PDF as an article in the PLP Academy Community.

Submit by **\[Due Date]** via your course portal.
