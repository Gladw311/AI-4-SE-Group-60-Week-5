Ethical Reflection – Predictive Model in Production (10%)
1. Potential Biases in the Dataset
Deploying a predictive model for resource allocation using the Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset or a similar one in a company setting introduces several ethical considerations, especially related to data bias and fairness. Potential biases may include:

Underrepresented Groups: If the data used in the model overrepresents certain departments, genders, age groups, or regions, the model may prioritize them unfairly when predicting issue severity or resource needs.

Labeling Bias: The “issue priority” labels (e.g., high/medium/low) may have been assigned subjectively by human annotators, which can introduce implicit human bias into the ground truth.

Historical Bias: The model might learn from patterns of past resource allocations that were unfair (e.g., certain teams consistently being deprioritized), and reinforce them in the future.

Feature Bias: If certain features correlate with demographic or organizational attributes (e.g., location, team ID), the model could inadvertently discriminate against specific groups.

2. Fairness Tools: IBM AI Fairness 360
To ensure the model behaves ethically and fairly, tools like IBM’s AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) can be applied. Here's how AIF360 can help:

Bias Detection: AIF360 provides metrics like Disparate Impact, Equal Opportunity Difference, and Statistical Parity Difference to quantify biases in model predictions.

Dataset Balancing: It offers preprocessing techniques like Reweighing and Disparate Impact Remover to adjust the training data to reduce bias.

In-processing Algorithms: Methods like Adversarial Debiasing and Prejudice Remover modify the model training process to actively avoid bias.

Post-processing Corrections: Algorithms like Equalized Odds Postprocessing adjust the output of the model to achieve fairness without changing the model itself.
